# YouTube-Spotify-ML
Supervised ML "Pocked Project"

## Description:
### This project uses a dataset that combines information about music tracks from Spotify and statistics about their music videos on YouTube. The data includes:

Target columns: 'Views', 'Likes'

Used sklearn and category_encoders and other ML libraries

At the beggining I dropped the URL's and unlicensed videos to make it more 'Legal'.

The main aim of this project was to apply all what I learned during 'IBM supervied ML' course.
